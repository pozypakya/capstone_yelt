*Online review becoming so important for business nowadays. Every review can effect the products buying power or services provided including the ratings which can quantifies the satisfaction of the reviewer's experience.*

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

The issue of using such real data in this  situation raises several significant questions such as :- 

1)  How to determine the extent of limited demographic information, data frequency, the privacy concerns of Yelp users and harsh message that might be censored by YELP administration.
2)  Accessing and processing method due to increasingly for larger datasets. Some algorithm like Random Forest required high iteration and processing. 
3)  Assuring a sample's diversity by implementing feature selection and optimal ratio selection for training and testing dataset for prediction in the future.
4)  Authentication or validation of the reviewer's identity, to reduce or eliminate bias in the reviewer comments so all the information is genuinely entered and the analysis result can be trusted.


```{r}
summary(cars)
summary(airquality)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(png)
png(height=600, width=600, pointsize=20, file="abc.png")
plot(cars)
dev.off()

```

```{r echo=FALSE , fig.width = 10, fig.height = 6 , message=F, warning=F}
library(png)
png(height=300, width=300, pointsize=15, file="def.png")
plot(airquality)
dev.off()


img1 <- readPNG('abc.png')
h<-dim(img1)[1]
w<-dim(img1)[2]
#plot(img1)

img2 <- readPNG('def.png')
h<-dim(img2)[1]
w<-dim(img2)[2]
#plot(img2)

img3 <- readPNG('cloud1.png')
h<-dim(img3)[1]
w<-dim(img3)[2]

#library("fields")
library("gridExtra")

#par(mfrow = c(1,2))
#plot(img1)
#plot(img2)
#plot(grid::grid.raster(img3))
#grid.arrange(img3, img3, ncol=2)
#a <- rasterImage(img1, 100, 300, 150, 350, interpolate = FALSE)
#plot(img1,useRaster=TRUE)
#grid::grid.raster(img1)
#img2 <- readPNG('def.png')
#b <- rasterImage(img2, 100, 300, 150, 350, interpolate = FALSE)
#img1
library("png")
library("raster")
#dev.new(width=5, height=2)
plot(0:2, 0:2, type = "n", xaxt = "n", yaxt = "n", xlab = "", ylab = "")
rasterImage(readPNG(source="abc.png"), 0, 1, 1, 2)
rasterImage(readPNG(source="cloud1.png"), 1, 1, 2, 2)
#rasterImage(readPNG(source="def.png"), 0, 0, 1, 1)
#rasterImage(readPNG(source="cloud1.png"), 1, 0, 2, 1)

```




Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
