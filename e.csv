Absolutely not.I'll do a follow up review for food up next.Just sat down. First off, customer service is excellent without a doubt. Keep in mind, I'm not paying the $30 price for this buffet, more like $45, so my expectations were already heightened. The food is good, along with the variety, but freshness was lacking. Their Seabass dish wasn't tender & really tasted old, but still tasted good, but not as fresh(as in cooked) as it could be. The best tasting thing was their truffled potatoes. Lots of desert options which also another plus!The food is more like a $20 range buffet & not even close to the $45 that I paid. I came here because ""USA Today"" rated it as the best Buffet.

After parking in the Palazzo and trekking it to the Venetian, did I realize the Lavo is in the Palazzo.  My suggestion is park in the Palazzo and look for the signs showing guest registration and you will run into Lavo. They do accept reservations so call ahead especially on busy nights. After three weeks of low carbing, pasta was the only thing on my mind. With a plethora of Italian restaurants off the strip, out of all the reviews, Lavo seemed to fit.  I chose to sit out on the patio, despite being 10pm it was still a cool 93F outside. With EDM playing in the background and the glimmering lights from the strip, it gives Lavo a very trendy feel.  They start you off with complimentary garlic bread wrapped in foil to keep it absolutely straight out of the oven warm. Paired with a red dipping sauce, it melted in my mouth. What was a portion intended for two people did not hold a chance once I began to devour the little bites of heaven. On to the entree. Spaghetti carbonara had my name or should I say my stomach written all over it.  The plate looks deceptively small but once you dig in to the mound of pasta, you know you are gonna walk away satisfied with the portion. The spaghetti carbonara did not disappoint. It was rich in flavor and solid meal all around. It's not the best I have had but considering the location and the ambiance, Lavo definitely deserves 5 stars.  I finished the meal with a white chocolate breading pudding. I wasn't expecting much when I ordered it but wow, what a surprise. It wasn't overpowering or too sweet. It had all the warm elements of a bread pudding with a slight bitter but sweet white chocolate taste. I had had gone into carb heaven a almost went comatose. If you are looking for a trendy Italian Las Vegas hot spot, Lavo will not disappoint.",Lavo is in the Palazzo next to guest registration.,1069

Some dressed to the nines and other in shorts and T-Shirts.  STK may not have a formal dress code but the ambiance deserves the common courtesy of looking presentable at the very minimum.  I of course decided on my blue pin striped suit with colorful pocket square to add that bit of splash. I went past the line and straight for the bar since you have access to their full menu. They have two bars here. If the first one is full continue towards the back and you will most likely find an open seat.  The bar tenders were absolute dolls and very attentive, making you feel at home.  With the DJ spinning tracks in the background and with dim lighting, it sets you up for an evening out on the town. First came out the bread which gets mad reviews from Yelpers across the board. I thought the hype was over the top, turns out it live up to it and plus more. I started my dinner with a field greens salad which I didn't expect much other than a common mixed greens salad.  It was amazing and definitely worth a try if you liked feta cheese. Beside the vinaigrette which was full flavored it had candied pecans which were succulent.On to the main course, their Colorado Rack of Lamb. Ordered it medium rare as any respective lamb lover should.  It was seasoned to perfection and sinfully marbled. You are almost forced to gnaw on the bone and since I was at the end of the bar counter, I couldn't help myself and sneaked in a couple of nibbles. It was simply that good. For desert, on recommendation the of the lovely bar tender, I went with the sweat potato donuts with caramelized walnuts. Mind you I hate anything sweet potato but after being referred to as honey, sweetie and babe the whole night I couldn't refuse the recommendation.I'm glad I did because it was epic and in the top three deserts i have ever had in Vegas. I paired it with a latte and it was to die for. A definite must have.","If you don't mind eating at the bar, skip the line, pass the first bar and towards the back there is a second bar usually with open seats. First come first serve.",702

They are $36 but they are huge! I'm not a cocktail guy but the vodka watermelon was UH-mazing!!! If you can finish one of these yourself and walk out sober, you need to seek help because you are officially a alcoholic. If you want to hang out and have fun, come to the sugar factory and don't count the calories.

Javier's is a little pricier than most Mexican restaurants but in my opinion well worth it.  If you are debating between Mexican Restaurants on the strip it blows Border Grill,and Diablos out of the water on every level.  If you are a Mexican food lover then i will say this is a must for you to try!I have eaten here many times and have always had excellent professional service and a great experience.  The restaurant itself is beautiful and has the nicest mexican ambiance and decor i have seen. The Food is excellent and what is really great about this place is that they have a lot of very sophisticated items on the menu that you don't typically find in most Mexican restaurants.   One dish thats different and I make sure somebody orders at the table  is the Camarones al mojo de ajo, or garlic shrimp. Another stand out is the Chile Verde special which is a pork dish and is most excellent.  I actually have them turn this into Chile Verde enchiladas when i go - a modification i highly recommend! :) The best appetizer is the chicken taquitos or the steak nachos.  The main dishes come with rice and beans and you have your choice of black/white refried or regular beans served in a cup.  Both are delicious! ( I prefer the white)No matter what you select for your meal you will be very pleased.  They use all fresh ingredients and the kitchen definitely knows what they are doing.  Food comes out hot and perfectly cooked every time.   Buen Provecho!",Best chips and salsa in Las Vegas,402

Because I dare to say (and a friend of mine will agree it is a bold statement) that if there is a Bachi Burger put in Los Angeles, this place will easily knock out my Number One burger spot!We got the ox tail chili fries and the truffle parmesan sweet potato fries.  Hoo Lee S***!  The truffle sauce and tomato aioli on the sweet potato fries are fantastic, and the chili fries are amazing!  I needed to look for my mama because I needed to slap her; yes it's that good!  And we didn't even get our burgers yet!  The red velvet shake was good, but was not something that stood out (maybe because I was having a food orgasm with the truffle fries!)The burgers were just as mind blowing.  I got the Miyagi-San burger that has a Wagyu beef patty, onion rings, fried egg, Furikake infused bacon and chili mayo.  Our friend got the Mr. Ho burger, with Angus beef, green onion, cilantro ginger, Hoisin mayo, Lup Cheng, Mizuna and mushrooms... ON A TARO BUN!!!
